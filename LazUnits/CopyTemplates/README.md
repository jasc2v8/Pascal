# Lazarus Project Template Manager

## Features

It must start with the word "Template" (not case sensitive).

2. ./TemplateHelpProject - a pre-configured Lazarus project with a LazHelpUnit.

3. ./TemplateThreadProject - a pre-configured Lazarus project with a LazThreadUnit.

4. ./TemplateWebProject - a pre-configured Lazarus project with your favorite web framework components.

5. ./TemplateWhateverProject - you get the idea...
