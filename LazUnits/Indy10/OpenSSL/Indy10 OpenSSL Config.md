# Indy 10 OpenSSL Config

## The key difference between HTTP and HTTPS

Indy 10 HTTP uses TIdHTTPServer.

Indy 10 HTTPS uses the same TIdHTTPServer with the IO handler TIdServerIOHandlerSSLOpenSSL.

		OpenSSL:=TIdServerIOHandlerSSLOpenSSL.Create;
		
		Server:=TIdHTTPServer.Create;
		IOHandler:= OpenSSL;

## SSL Version and Ciphers

Choosing TLSv1.2 will be compatiable with all modern desktop and mobile browsers.
	
This is specifically not compatiable with older browsers for improved security.
	
		SSLOptions.SSLVersions := [sslvTLSv1_2];
	
This makes the cipher list easy to configure:
	
		OpenSSL.SSLOptions.CipherList := 'TLSv1.2:!NULL';
		
TLSv1.2 is reasonably secure until future Indy support of TLSv1.3
